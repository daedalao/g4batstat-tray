# g4batstat-tray
GTK Battery Status for PowerBook G4

I didn't write this, I just coaxed an LLM to write this for me. It's probably broken and I don't know how to fix it.

This was the compiler command. I built this on ArchLinuxPOWER. 

```bash
gcc -o g4batstat-tray g4batstat-tray.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```
